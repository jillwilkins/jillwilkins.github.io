Welcome! I am currently working on my Ph.D. in Economics at Emory University. My research interests include health economics and policy. I was born and raiased in Dallas, Texas and prior to coming to Emory I completed my Masters in Public Service and Administration at The Bush School of Government and Public Service and my B.S. in Economics at Texas A&M University. At The Bush School, I was able to concentrate my work in Policy Analysis.
